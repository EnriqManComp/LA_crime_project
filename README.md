# LA Crime Analysis

## What we need to solve ?

We take the role of a local government that needs to allocate law enforcement resources based on different factors of crimes committed in LA city.

Also, we need to keep tracking various statistics to get information about the nature of crimes in LA. We group the statistics as follows:
- Percentage of the rate of committed crimes based on the previous year.
- Most dangerous hours.
- Number of offenses committed by area or LAPD district.
- Density map of the crime records by LAPD district.
- Percentage of crimes in different age ranges.
